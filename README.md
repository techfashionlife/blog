Hello,

This is my personal blog about things I am passionate about - technology, fashion, and how to live a great life.

I am a female software engineer in San Francisco. I found my life to be so busy that I often neglect thinking and reviewing what I have done in my life.

This blog is an initiative for me to start recognizing what I have done and what I want in my life.

Thanks y'all for reading and I hope you will find things that interest you in my blog =3

Cheers,
Cindy
